# TESLA-Social-Media-Strategy-Proposal

# Background
# Using social media, TESLA motors has been actively engaging its current car owners and potential customers. TESLA is currently leading the electric vehicles market and has changed the auto industry (e.g. significant advancement towards fully autonomous vehicles, Autopilot, and direct purchase from car manufacturer). TESLA has its unique social media strategy based on a referral program that incentivises its consumers and advocates to generate organic brand related content.

# In a hypothetical scenario, a corporate social media group is formed to establish a more coherent voice for TESLA. At present, the car marker is performing well with its online engagement specifically on Youtube and Twitter mostly through organic brand related content posted by existing car owners with an allocated budget to a referral program that incentivises such content. One of next critical objectives of the group is to develop a social media strategy. “Everything with social comes down to content,” said the social media lead of the group.

# Your team is approached by the social media group to find out what they should do with the social media strategy of TESLA, especially those that would engage customers. 

# Executive Summary
# This social media strategy proposal examines Tesla’s current social media strategy performance and identifies two potential areas that requires further improvements: social media contents and online customer service. Based on that, three specific social media strategies are proposed for better social media presence. First, promote organic engagements with social media campaigns. Second, adjust frequency and timing of online posting. Third, implement chatbots for online customer service. Several limitations and potential risks are also introduced in the evaluation part of this social media strategy proposal.
